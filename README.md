# cryptography
A repository to check out and analyze various and progressive ways of data encryption for information security.
This folder includes various methods to encrypt and decrypt data like the Ceasar Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and Vigenere Cipher with a well-defined menu-driven code to provide the user a choice algorithm to conveniently operate around cryptographic processes. 
Every encryption and it's subsequent decryption is achieved using Python.
Comments are provided for the user to traverse around the code easier to locate certain components of the code.
Feel free to add to this folder, Happy Coding!
